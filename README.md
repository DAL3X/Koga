An Android app to help decide what to eat!

Foods can be added in regards to the following properties: Likeness-Score, Health-Score, Main-Carbohydrate and Contains-Meat.

The app can then generate food plans according to configurable parameters. This allows for food plans that are healthy, don't contain too much of the same carbohydrate and are not as meat heavy!
